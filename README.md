## About 

RandomUserApp is an application for displaying a list of random users with their contacts and other information.<br>
This project was created as a test case for an internship.<br><br>
You can swipe to refresh on the home screen.<br>
You can also click on each item in the list. This will take you to a screen with more advanced user data.<br> 
On the extended screen, you can tap on phone number, email, or location, which will open the appropriate application that will process this data (maps for example)
